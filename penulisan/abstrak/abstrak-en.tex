The rapid advancement of information technology has led to an exponential increase in the volume of data generated and stored daily. This surge demands efficient and scalable distributed computing platforms to process large-scale data effectively. Hadoop and Spark are two widely adopted platforms that offer solutions for Big Data processing. This study aims to compare the performance of Hadoop and Spark in processing large datasets on the DigitalOcean cloud platform, focusing on the word count and sort workloads, which are foundational for numerous data science applications. Word count is utilized in constructing Bag-of-Words (BoW) for text processing, while sort plays a crucial role in TF-IDF weighting. Both platforms were tested using the HiBench benchmark with varying data sizes ranging from 100 KB to 15 GB. The findings reveal that Spark significantly outperforms Hadoop in terms of execution time, particularly for large datasets. While Hadoop demonstrates efficiency with smaller to medium-sized datasets, Spark excels in handling larger data volumes. In the sort workload, Spark consistently outperforms Hadoop starting from 5 GB of data. Similarly, in the word count workload, Spark's superiority is evident with data sizes exceeding 500 MB. Furthermore, Spark proved to be more efficient in utilizing CPU and memory resources, while minimizing disk I/O operations. These findings establish Spark as a more scalable and efficient platform for large-scale data processing compared to Hadoop, particularly for word count and sort tasks, which form the bedrock of many data science applications. This study provides valuable insights to guide practitioners in selecting the most suitable platform for their data processing requirements.}
